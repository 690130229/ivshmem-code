/* This class contains constants and "macros" for the FTP apps.
 * Memory is laid out as follows:
 * First chunk is for synchronization - 3 ints for each of 32 clients is only 384 bytse but we have memory to spare.
 * Next 480 chunks are 32 blocks of 15 chunks each.
 *   - The first chunk contains locks and full/empty counts.
 *   - The other chunks are used for data transfer.
 * The rest of the memory is unused.
